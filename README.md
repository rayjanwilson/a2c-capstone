## Engagement Manager Info
- [Internal weekly status report format](https://confluence.aws-proserve.org/confluence/display/EDF/How+to+produce+a+weekly+status+-+Internal) provided by Dave Sumner
    - not everyone will have access to it, but that's ok
- This [wiki link](https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Technical%20Program%20Manager/Reporting%20Status) describes the status reporting

## Git Branching Strategy
- We will use the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching strategy
- This strategy uses two branches to record the history of the project: **master** and **dev**
- Each new feature should have its own branch, working off of dev (instead of branching off of master). 
- Naming convention for feature branches: issueNumber-issueDescription. Do not use spaces. For example: *32-update-readme-git-branching-strategy*
- When a feature is developed, it should be merged into dev through a pull request. 
- Dev will occasionally be merged into master through a pull request.
